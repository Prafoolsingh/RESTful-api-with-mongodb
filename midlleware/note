In Postman, create a new request to access the protected /secret endpoint. Set the request type to GET and the URL to http://localhost:<your_port>/secret, where <your_port> is the port your server is running on. Include the JWT token in the request headers under the Authorization key. The header should look like Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>.
